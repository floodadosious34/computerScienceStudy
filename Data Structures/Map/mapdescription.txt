Map https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map
The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. 
Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

Description
Map objects are collections of key-value pairs. A key in the Map may only occur once; it is unique in the Map's collection. A Map object is iterated by key-value pairs — a for...of loop returns a 2-member array of [key, value] for each iteration. Iteration happens in insertion order, which corresponds to the order in which each key-value pair was first inserted into the map by the set() method (that is, there wasn't a key with the same value already in the map when set() was called).

The specification requires maps to be implemented "that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collection". Therefore, it could be represented internally as a hash table (with O(1) lookup), a search tree (with O(log(N)) lookup), or any other data structure, as long as the complexity is better than O(N).

Key equality
Key equality is based on the sameValueZero algorithm.
NaN is considered the same as NaN (even though NaN !== NaN) and all other values are considered equal according to the semantics of the === operator.
In the current ECMAScript specification, -0 and +0 are considered equal, although this was not so in earlier drafts. See "Value equality for -0 and 0" in the Browser compatibility table for details.
Objects vs. Maps
Object is similar to Map—both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. For this reason (and because there were no built-in alternatives), Object has been used as Map historically.

However, there are important differences that make Map preferable in some cases:
